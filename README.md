## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Basic understanding of C programming

### Compilation
To compile any C file:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output_name
```

### Running Programs
```bash
./output_name
```

## üìã Categories Overview

### Basic Programming
- Arithmetic operations
- Variable declarations
- Pointer operations
- Function implementations
- Conditional statements

### Data Structures
- **Arrays**: CRUD operations, insertion, binary search
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, Doubly, Circular implementations
- **Stacks**: Implementation and operations
- **Trees**: Binary trees, BST implementations
- **Graphs**: Adjacency lists, DFS, BFS, Floyd-Warshall

### Algorithms
- Sorting algorithms
- Searching algorithms
- Graph algorithms
- Mathematical problems
- String manipulation

### Problem Solving
- LeetCode solutions
- HackerRank challenges
- GeeksForGeeks problems
- Competitive programming questions

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Code Style
The project follows C programming best practices with:
- Proper variable naming conventions
- Modular code organization
- Comments for documentation
- Error handling where applicable

### File Naming Convention
- Descriptive filenames indicating the problem/algorithm
- `.c` files contain source code
- `.exe` files are compiled executables (Windows)

## üìö Learning Path

1. Start with **Basics/** for fundamental concepts
2. Move to **conditional/** and **functions/** for control flow
3. Practice with **Arrays/** and basic data structures
4. Advance to **DSA/** for complex data structures
5. Solve problems in **LEETCODE/** and **HackerRank--GFG/**

## üîß Tools Used

- **Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Editor**: Visual Studio Code (based on .vscode directory)
- **Version Control**: Git (based on .git directory)
- **Code Formatting**: Clang-format (based on .clang-format file)

## üìù Notes

- Each directory contains both source code (.c) and compiled executables (.exe)
- Problems are organized by difficulty and category
- Solutions include both basic implementations and optimized approaches
- Some directories contain question lists (AAAAQuestions.txt) for practice
